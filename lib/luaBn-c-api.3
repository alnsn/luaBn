.Sh NAME
.Nm luaBn-c-api
.Nd C interface of the luaBn library
.Sh LIBRARY
luaBn Library (luaBn, \-lluaBn \-lcrypto)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In luaBn.h
.Ft int
.Fn luaBn_open "lua_State *L"
.Ft BIGNUM *
.Fn luaBn_tobignum "lua_State *L" "int narg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
specifies C interface of the luaBn library.
.Pp
In order yo use the library, you should initialize it with
.Fn luaBn_open .
It's recommended to call
.Xr ERR_load_BN_strings 3
prior to calling
.Fn luaBn_open
for a better error reporting.
The library uses Lua state for storing global variables (such as
.Xr BN_CTX 3
objects) and it's possible to have multiple instances of the library
open in multiple Lua states and running in multiple threads.
.Pp
Lua string, number or bn.bignum object can be converted to
.Xr BIGNUM 3
object using
.Fn luaBn_tobignum
function.
